    <h1 class="sec-title">About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a designer and researcher focused on how children think, learn, and make
      sense of the world. My work blends learning sciences, child development,
      human–computer interaction, and curriculum design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I graduated from the University of Michigan — Ann Arbor with a
      <strong>B.S. in Computer Science</strong> and a <strong>minor in Mathematics</strong>.
      I’ve taught and tutored learners across ages, and I care deeply about creating
      technology and curriculum that feel intuitive, warm, and cognitively supportive —
      especially for neurodivergent students.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interests include early cognitive skill development, metacognition,
      creativity in learning environments, and playful computational tools.
      I’m preparing for doctoral study where I hope to explore how educational technologies
      can better support curiosity and equitable opportunities for young learners.
