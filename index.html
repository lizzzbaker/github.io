        <h1>Hi, I’m Elizabeth.</h1>

        <p>
          I design learning experiences and educational tools that help spark
          children's imagination, and inspire them to think more creatively in a world 
          increasingly shaped by technology. My interest sits at the intersection of how kids 
          learn and how beautifully crafted systems can guide their attention, strengthen early cognitive habits, 
          and spark that feeling of “I get it.”
        </p>

        <p>
         I graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 
          My background in teaching and tutoring K–5 learners heavily influences how I design. I aim to 
          build tools that feel intuitive, fun, and adaptable because I’ve seen how differently 
          children process the same idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          My work blends learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and curriculum design, 
          with a focus on supporting neurodivergent learners whose strengths are often overlooked. 
          This portfolio is a snapshot of the tools, research, and playful experiments I’m creating 
          as I progress toward doctoral study.
