        <h1>Hi, I’m Elizabeth.</h1>

        <p>
          I design learning experiences and educational tools that help spark
          children's imagination, and inspire them to think more creatively in a world 
          increasingly shaped by technology. My interest sits at the intersection of how kids 
          learn and how beautifully crafted systems can guide their attention, strengthen early cognitive habits, 
          and spark that feeling of “I get it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Science 
          and a deep love for building things that feel both intuitive and human. 
          My work blends learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and curriculum design, 
          with a particular commitment to supporting neurodivergent learners whose 
          brilliance often slips through the cracks of traditional schooling.

        </p>

        <p>
          This portfolio is a living snapshot of the tools, research, and playful experiments 
          I’m building as I move toward doctoral study and continue exploring how technology 
          can encourage children to learn in ways that honor their unique minds.

        </p>
