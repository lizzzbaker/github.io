      <h1>Hi, I’m Elizabeth.</h1>

      <p>
        I design learning experiences, interfaces, and educational tools that help
        children think more clearly and creatively in a world shaped by technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor with a B.S. in Computer
        Science and a minor in Mathematics. Much of my work is grounded in curiosity,
        cognitive development, and human–computer interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love teaching and tutoring. I’ve supported learners across math, CS, and
        foundational problem-solving—and this hands-on experience deeply informs my design
        philosophy. I’m especially interested in research at the intersection of learning
        sciences and interaction design.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is where I explore ideas, share prototypes, and build small experiments
        as I prepare for doctoral study.
