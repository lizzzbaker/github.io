          <h3>Teaching in the Age of ChatGPT</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            AI tools can spark creativity and make learning feel effortless,
            but this convenience can hinder the vital thinking skills children need to develop.
            Here, I explore how teachers can use AI without letting it replace curiosity,
            deep reasoning, or the productive struggle that builds real understanding.

          <h3>Building Brain Power: How Reflection Helps Young Learners Grow</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            This piece shows how everyday moments can become powerful opportunities for kids to
            reflect on their thinking. By weaving metacognition into play, teachers help children discover
            their strategies, strengths, and growing independence as learners.

          <h3>Rethinking Assessment: How Neurodivergent Brains Show Knowledge Differently</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Traditional tests often miss the brilliance of neurodivergent learners. This article explores
            why standardized exams overlook visual, intuitive, and non-linear thinkers — and how authentic
            assessments, multiple-intelligences–aligned tasks, and portfolios offer a fairer, deeper window
            into what children truly understand.
