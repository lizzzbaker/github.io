          <h3>Building Brain Power: How Reflection Helps Young Learners Grow</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            This piece shows how everyday moments can become powerful opportunities for kids to
            reflect on their thinking. By weaving metacognition into play, teachers help children discover
            their strategies, strengths, and growing independence as learners.

          <h3>Addressing Healthcare Inequality through Predictive Analytics</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            This project investigates how geography, income, and hospital quality shape unequal 
            health outcomes across the United States. Using large federal datasets, we engineered 
            a machine-learning model that predicts a community’s healthcare “risk level” by ZIP code. Capturing 
            factors like patient satisfaction, infection rates, and local provider availability, Our
            model achieved 91% accuracy. It also powers an interactive U.S. map, allowing 
            users to visualize healthcare disparities in real time. The work blends data science and 
            public policy to offer a practical tool for policymakers and advocates seeking more equitable 
            healthcare systems.

          <h3>Open-Source Contribution: Improving MuseScore’s Governance & Developer Experience</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            In this project, we contributed to MuseScore, one of the world’s most widely 
            used open-source music notation platforms. We focused on two improvements: enhancing the UI 
            by replacing a confusing “[LINK]” label with a clean icon and dynamic tooltip, 
            and creating new developer documentation that fixes a common build error in Visual Studio. 
            These contributions required navigating a large C++/Qt codebase, performing UI updates in QML, 
            running visual regression tests, and writing onboarding-ready technical guides. 
            The work strengthened the project’s accessibility for both users and new contributors, 
            and the maintainers invited parts of it into the official MuseScore Wiki.

          <h3>Rethinking Assessment: How Neurodivergent Brains Show Knowledge Differently</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Traditional tests often miss the brilliance of neurodivergent learners. This article explores
            why standardized exams overlook visual, intuitive, and non-linear thinkers — and how authentic
            assessments, multiple-intelligences–aligned tasks, and portfolios offer a fairer, deeper window
            into what children truly understand.

          <h3>Teaching in the Age of ChatGPT</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            AI tools can spark creativity and make learning feel effortless,
            but this convenience can hinder the vital thinking skills children need to develop.
            Here, I explore how teachers can use AI without letting it replace curiosity,
            deep reasoning, or the productive struggle that builds real understanding.
